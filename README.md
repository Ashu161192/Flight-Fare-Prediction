# Flight-Fare-Prediction
# Project Descriptions

This Project is used to predict the flight prices. We will use Flight Price Dataset provided by Kaggle Flight Price. This dataset consists of 10683 records with 11 columns that explain about the flight in India by some Indian and foreign Airlines in 2019. We will analyze this dataset using Machine learning techniques in order to predict the flight ticket price based on the features provided in the columns of the dataset. We will begin the Data Science Life Cycle to process the data such as Cleaning the dataset, feature engineering, splitting dataset, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

# Modelling and Evaluation Algorithms 
1.Linear regression 

2.Lasso Regularizaton is used to improve model performance.

3.Random Forest regressor and apply gridsearch cross validation.

4.Metric - Since the target variable is a continuous variable, regression evaluation metric RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination) have been used.
